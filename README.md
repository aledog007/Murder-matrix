# Murder Matrix 

## About the Project 

In school, we received an assignment to program a Zork game in Java. Benni and I decided to work together on this project. You can find further information/Documentation about the assignment [here](https://wiki.c.foobar.vip/s/179d82da-817a-4f85-822a-c9db4a8e7a38/doc/murder-matrix-SNW6tfuG4z)

## The Story

In the gloomy alleyways of the small town of Willow's
Rest, a sinister crime adventure unfolds. It is the early
16th century, and the shadow of a murderer lies over the streets. With
night falls, the killer sneaks out of his hiding place and strikes again.
and strikes again, and every dawn finds one less villager.
The player takes on the role of the detective who has to play this
single-player thriller adventure alone against the darkness.


But watch out: Willow's Rest is full of suspicious
personalities. Each villager behaves differently and presents themselves as a
distinctive character. These personalities, all modelled by an AI based on the latest
modelled using the latest technology, have their own habits, inclinations
and perhaps secrets.
The investigation leads through the old rooms and alleyways
alleys of the village, every corner harbours traces and clues to possible
weapons: a dagger, an old musket, perhaps a vial of poison.
Conversations in each room allow you to gradually elicit information from the villagers.
information from the villagers. Some help during the day, while others whisper
rumours that may mislead the player. The AI
spreads these rumours skilfully, so that only by listening and observing carefully
the truth can come to light.

As night falls, time is running out, because every dawn the murderer has struck again.
The atmosphere intensifies, the rustic/retro aesthetic of the old ASCII style making the
village seem mysterious and ominous.

The player collects all the necessary evidence during the day and then has to decide:
Who is the murderer? Only if the right villager is confronted with convincing arguments
and the right murder weapon will this deadly game come to an end. If not, the story ends in darkness for the detective and the rest of Willow.
